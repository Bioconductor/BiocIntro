# Using _R_ and _Bioconductor_ to tackle bioinformatic challenges in epigenomics

This workshop provides an introduction to _R_ / _Bioconductor_, motivated by epigenomic use cases.

Participants should have some experience using _R_, including use of _RStudio_. Participants should come with a laptop with WiFi access. Participants should be familiar with scientific concepts in epigenomics, including a basic understanding how methylation arrays and ChIP-seq experiments can inform biological insight.

The workshop will start with an overall orientation to _Bioconductor_ software and annotation resources. We'll then explore typical steps in a _Bioconductor_ workflow for analysis of methylation arrays using the [minfi][] package, and similar steps in the analysis of ChIP-seq data using the [csaw][] package. We place results from these workflows into biological context using _Bioconductor_ annotation resources, and conclude with mention of advanced and emerging areas of _Bioconductor_ relevance.
