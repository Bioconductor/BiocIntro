# Introduction

This package provides an ice-breaker for getting to know
people. It has tips for shouting or whispering to them, or just
speaking in a normal voice. The latter is usually best for making
friends.

# Use

To use this package, load it

```{r}
library(MyPackage)
````

and greet one or more friends.

```{r}
hi(c("Martin", "Jenny"))
```

Shout if your friends are hard of hearing or seem to be ignoring
you

```{r}
hi(c("Martin", "Jenny"), "shout")
```

Whisper in more intimate situations or to avoid bothering others.

```{r}
hi("Martin", "whisper")
```
