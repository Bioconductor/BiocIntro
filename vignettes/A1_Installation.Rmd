# Easy installation

## Windows

NOTE: See [Windows installation instructions][Windows] for more detail.

It may be necessary to do the following steps with an "Administrator"
account.

To install _R_, visit the [Windows base][] distribution page. Click on
the `Download R-3.3.2 for Windows` link. Click on the installer and
make the default selection for each option.

To install _RStudio_, visit the [RStudio download][] page. Click on
the `RStudio 1.0.136 - Windows Vista/7/8/10` link. Click on the
installer and follow default instructions.

Be sure to switch back to your regular account before starting to use
the software that you have just installed.

## Mac

NOTE: See [R for Mac OS X][MacOS] for more detail.

To install _R_, visit the [R for Mac OS X][MacOS]. Click on the the
`R-3.3.2.pkg` link. Click on the installer and follow default
instructions.

To install _RStudio_, visit the [RStudio download][] page. Click on
the `RStudio 1.0.136 - Mac OS X 10.6+ (64-bit)` link. Click on the
installer and follow default instructions.

## Linux

NOTE: See [distribution-specific instructions][Linux-distro] for
additional detail.

On debian-based systems, the easiest way to install _R_ is through a
package manager manager, run under an administrator account.  On Linux
one usually needs to install _R_ packages from source, and _R_ package
source often contains C, C++, or Fortran code requiring a compiler and
`-dev` versions of various system libraries. It is therefore
convenient to install the `-dev` version of R.

```
sudo apt-get install r-base r-base-dev
```

When installing source packages, it may be necessary to have access to
the `-dev` version of various system libraries. Many of these are
installed as dependencies of `r-base-dev`; other common examples
include the xml and curl libraries

```
sudo apt-get install libxml2-dev
sudo apt-get install libcurl-dev
```

Note in particular the use specification of libraries (the `lib`
prefix) and the use of the `-dev` version.

To install _RStudio_, visit the [RStudio download][] page. Download
the appropriate archive by clicking on the `RStudio 1.0.136 - ` link
for your OS. On Ubuntu, install the `.deb` installer with

```
sudo dpkg -i rstudio-1.0.136-amd64.deb
```

# Advanced Installation (**NOT** required for this course)

Advanced installation is required to (a) install custom packages that
(b) have their own C, C++, or Fortran code. In all other cases, the
easy installation is sufficient.

## Windows (**NOT** required for this course)

Advanced installation requires `Rtools34.exe`, available the
[Rtools][] web site. Download and click on the installer. Answer all
installer questions with default values. The two most tricky parts
are:

1. Be sure to install the Rtools softare in a directory path that does
   not include spaces.
2. Be sure that the system enironment variable PATH contains the path
   to the Rtools `bin` directory.

## Mac (**NOT** required for this course)

### Install Xcode and Xcode command line tools
Make sure you have Xcode and Xcode command line tools installed on your mac. If not,
you can run the following command on your terminal application to install Code

```{bash xcode-install, eval=FALSE}
xcode-select --install
```

For command line tools, go to http://developer.apple.com/downloads and sign in with
your Apple ID (the same one you use for iTunes and app purchases). Look for 'Command line tools'
through the search box, download the required file and install via the `.dmg` file on your machine.

For more detailed instructions on this, please visit [this link](https://www.moncefbelyamani.com/how-to-install-xcode-homebrew-git-rvm-ruby-on-mac/#laptop-script).

### Install of R and RStudio using homebrew (easy!)

Open your terminal application on your mac. Follow the steps below:

* Install [homebrew](http://brew.sh/) on your machine, copy and paste this in your terminal.

```{bash hombrew-install, eval=FALSE}
/usr/bin/ruby -e "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/master/install)"
```

* Update the "taps" on your machine and check if everything is fine.  

```{bash brew-update, eval=FALSE}
brew update && brew doctor
```

* Get brew cask and the homebrew science taps

```{bash brew-cask, eval=FALSE}
# Brew taps and requirements
brew tap caskroom/cask
brew tap homebrew/science
brew install caskroom/cask/brew-cask
```

* Install Xquartz and Java

```{bash xquartz-java, eval=FALSE}
# Dependencies
brew cask install xquartz
brew cask install java
```

* Finally install R and Rstudio

```{bash install-r, eval=FALSE}
# Install R with X11
brew install --with-x11 r

# Install RStudio
brew cask install --appdir=/Applications rstudio
```

Note: the inclusion of the `--appdir` option. By default, Cask formulaâ€™s will
create aliases in `~/Applications`, but this option tells Homebrew to use
`/Applications` instead

* For more functionality with making documents with code embedded within it
  (literate programming),you have to install `LaTeX` on your machine as well.

```{bash install-latex, eval=FALSE}
# For latex:
brew cask install mactex

brew install libsvg curl libxml2 gdal geos boost

R CMD javareconf JAVA_CPPFLAGS=-I/System/Library/Frameworks/JavaVM.framework/Headers
```

### Advanced R installation i.e compile from source

This step is not recommended for new users and it would be much easier installing
R using homebrew.

We assume that the users have the following software installed,

1. XCode and Xcode command line tools.
2. **gfortran**, **pcre**, and **liblzma**  
3. XQuartz (https://www.xquartz.org/)
4. Java JRE (jre-8u111-macosx-x64)

* If `gfortran`, `pcre` or `liblzma` is not installed on your machine, you can
  follow the steps below. These steps help you install binaries of these programs
  without having to compile them from scratch.

One thing to keep in mind is the version of OSX being run, i.e take note of the
binaries you download from http://r.research.att.com/libs/. Most people should be
having OS-X Snow leopard or higher.

**darwin_id** | **Mac OS version**
----------|---------------
darwin8   | for Mac OS X 10.4 (Tiger) or higher
darwin89  | 32-bit for Mac OS X 10.4 or higher, 64-bit for Mac OS X 10.5 or higher
darwin9   | for Mac OS X 10.5 (Leopard) or higher
darwin10  | for Mac OS X 10.6 (Snow Leopard) or higher
darwin13  | for Mac OS X 10.9 (Mavericks) or higher


```{bash install-binaries, eval=FALSE}
#  This is for mac OS sierra

##  Gfortran
curl -O 'http://r.research.att.com/libs/gfortran-4.8.2-darwin13.tar.bz2'
sudo tar fxvz gfortran-4.8.2-darwin13.tar.bz2 -C /

## XZ library or liblzma
curl -O 'http://r.research.att.com/libs/xz-5.2.1-darwin.13-x86_64.tar.gz'
sudo tar fvxz xz-5.2.1-darwin.13-x86_64.tar.gz -C /

## pcre

curl -O 'http://r.research.att.com/libs/pcre-8.36-darwin.13-x86_64.tar.gz'
sudo tar fvxz pcre-8.36-darwin.13-x86_64.tar.gz -C /
```

* The next step is to download R from its source, by checkout from its `svn`
  repository.

```{bash svn-r, eval=FALSE}
# I'm making a new directory in my home called "R-stuff"
mkdir ~/R-stuff

# SVN checkouto R-devel or a specific version of R. The rest of this document
# will show the workflow for devel version of R. But the steps are the same for
# the release version as well.

svn checkout https://svn.r-project.org/R/trunk/ ~/R-stuff/devel

# or both. (if you want to have devel and release versions of R on your machine)

svn checkout https://svn.r-project.org/R/branches/R-3-3-branch/ ~/R-stuff/release-3-3
```

* Download recommended packages for R, this is available after you change into your
  `devel or release-3-3`  directory.

```{bash tool-sync, eval=FALSE}
# Download recommmended packages
./tools/rsync-recommended
```

* Be sure to configure R in a different directory as to where it was downloaded.
  All the libraries being installed will go into that directory.

```{bash r-install, eval=FALSE}
# make a new directory to configure R

mkdir -p ~/R-stuff/bin/R-devel

cd ~/R-stuff/bin/R-devel

~/R-stuff/devel/configure --enable-R-shlib --enable-R-profiling --enable-memory-profiling --with-internal-tzcode=no
```

* Once the configuration goes through without any errors, run make

```{bash, eval=FALSE}
# run make
make

# Then check the built system works correctly by
make check
```

* Install R-studio from this [link](https://www.rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/).

  Once R-studio is installed, and you have manually compiled R, you have to create an
  alias for your R-studio in your .bashrc or whatever shell you are using on your machine.

  The alias will look like,

```{bash alias-r-studio, eval=FALSE}
# R release version; i.e latest release branch, use absolute paths
# when making aliases. This makes it accessible by just using R in the
# terminal.
alias R="/Users/hansolo/R-stuff/bin/R-devel/bin/R"

# This tells Rstudio which R to use as default
export RSTUDIO_WHICH_R=/Users/hansolo/R-stuff/bin/R-devel/bin/R;
```

* If you have multiple versions of R installed on your machine via source compilation,
  one way to refer to multiple version of R and Rstudio via aliases is given below.

  In your `.bashrc` you can have something like:

```{bash multiple-sources, eval=FALSE}
# R release/patched version; i.e latest release branch
alias R-release="/Users/hansolo/R-stuff/bin/R-3-3-branch/bin/R"
alias RStudio-release="export RSTUDIO_WHICH_R=/Users/hansolo/R-stuff/bin/R-3-3-branch/bin/R; open -a RStudio"

# R devel setup
alias R-dev="/Users/hansolo/R-stuff/bin/R-devel/bin/R"
alias RStudio-dev="export RSTUDIO_WHICH_R=/Users/hansolo/R-Stuff/bin/R-devel/bin/R; open -a RStudio"
```

Now you can call your **R-release** version using the command `R-release` and if you use the command `RStudio-release` , Rstudio will use the release version of R. Same goes with the commands `R-dev` and `RStudio-dev`.


**All done!!**


Try out the installation in a new terminal or after sourcing your `.bashrc` by

```{bash source-bash, eval=FALSE}
source ~/.bashrc
```

You should be all set and ready to use R!


## Linux (**NOT** required for this course)

NOTE: see [distribution-specific instructions][Linux-distro] and the
[R Installation and Administration][R-admin] manual for definitive
directions.

For advanced Linux installation, a typical approach is 'checkout' the
_R_ source code from its SVN version control repository and retrieve
recommended packages.

```
mkdir ~/src
cd ~/src
svn checkout https://svn.r-project.org/R/branches/R-3-3-branch
tools/rsync-recommended
```

The next step is to configure the software, typically in an indepenent
'bin' directory

```
mkdir ~/bin
cd ~/bin/R-3-3-branch
~/src/R-3-3-branch/configure
```

There are a number of configure options, see
`~/src/R-3-3-branch/configure`. Typical problems during configuration
involve missing system libraries; the `-dev` versions of these
libraries need to be installed by a system administrator.

The final step is to build the software

```
cd ~/bin/R-3-3-branch
make -j
```

The executable is at `~/bin/R-3-3-branch/bin/R`; it is convenient to
add `~/bin/R-3-3-branch/bin` to the system `PATH` variable or to
create a shell alias pointing to the executable. A system-wide installation can be made available with

```
sudo make install
```
