# Install Xcode and Xcode command line tools
Make sure you have Xcode and Xcode command line tools installed on your mac. If not,
you can run the following command on your terminal application to install Code

```{bash xcode-install, eval=FALSE}
xcode-select --install
```

For command line tools, go to http://developer.apple.com/downloads and sign in with 
your Apple ID (the same one you use for iTunes and app purchases). Look for 'Command line tools' 
through the search box, download the required file and install via the `.dmg` file on your machine.

# Simple Install of R and RStudio

Open your terminal application on your mac. Follow the steps below:

* Install [homebrew](http://brew.sh/) on your machine, copy and paste this in your terminal.

```{bash hombrew-install, eval=FALSE}
/usr/bin/ruby -e "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/master/install)"
```
* Update the "taps" on your machine and check if everything is fine.  
```{bash brew-update, eval=FALSE}
brew update && brew doctor
```

* Get brew cask and the homebrew science taps

```{bash brew-cask, eval=FALSE}
# Brew taps and requirements
brew tap caskroom/cask
brew tap homebrew/science
brew install caskroom/cask/brew-cask
```

* Install Xquartz and Java

```{bash xquartz-java, eval=FALSE}
# Dependencies 
brew cask install xquartz
brew cask install java
```

* Finally install R and Rstudio

```{bash install-r, eval=FALSE}
# Install R with X11
brew install --with-x11 r

# Install RStudio 
brew cask install --appdir=/Applications rstudio
```

Note: the inclusion of the `--appdir` option. By default, Cask formulaâ€™s will create aliases in `~/Applications`, but this option tells Homebrew to use /Applications instead

* For more functionality with making documents with code embedded within it (literate programming),
  you have to install `LaTeX` on your machine as well.

```{bash install-latex, eval=FALSE}
# For latex:
brew cask install mactex
    
brew install libsvg curl libxml2 gdal geos boost
 
R CMD javareconf JAVA_CPPFLAGS=-I/System/Library/Frameworks/JavaVM.framework/Headers
```


# Advanced R installation i.e compile from source 

This step is not recommended for new users and it would be much easier installing
R using homebrew.

We assume that the users have the following software installed,

1. XCode and Xcode command line tools.
2. **gfortran**, **pcre**, and **liblzma**  
3. XQuartz (https://www.xquartz.org/)
4. Java JRE (jre-8u111-macosx-x64)

* If `gfortran`, `pcre` or `liblzma` is not installed on your machine, you can follow 
  the steps below. These steps help you install binaries of these programs without
  having to compile them from scratch.
    
One thing to keep in mind is the version of OSX being run, i.e take note of the 
binaries you download from http://r.research.att.com/libs/. Most people should be having
OS-X Snow leopard or higher. 

**darwin_id** | **Mac OS version**
----------|---------------
darwin8   | for Mac OS X 10.4 (Tiger) or higher
darwin89  | 32-bit for Mac OS X 10.4 or higher, 64-bit for Mac OS X 10.5 or higher
darwin9   | for Mac OS X 10.5 (Leopard) or higher
darwin10  | for Mac OS X 10.6 (Snow Leopard) or higher
darwin13  | for Mac OS X 10.9 (Mavericks) or higher


```{bash install-binaries, eval=FALSE}
#  This is for mac OS sierra

##  Gfortran
curl -O 'http://r.research.att.com/libs/gfortran-4.8.2-darwin13.tar.bz2'
sudo tar fxvz gfortran-4.8.2-darwin13.tar.bz2 -C /

## XZ library or liblzma
curl -O 'http://r.research.att.com/libs/xz-5.2.1-darwin.13-x86_64.tar.gz'
sudo tar fvxz xz-5.2.1-darwin.13-x86_64.tar.gz -C /

## pcre 

curl -O 'http://r.research.att.com/libs/pcre-8.36-darwin.13-x86_64.tar.gz'
sudo tar fvxz pcre-8.36-darwin.13-x86_64.tar.gz -C / 
```

* The next step is to download R from its source, by checkout from its `svn`
  repository.

```{bash svn-r, eval=FALSE}
# I'm making a new directory in my home called "R-stuff"
mkdir ~/R-stuff

# SVN checkouto R-devel or a specific version of R. The rest of this document
# will show the workflow for devel version of R. But the steps are the same for 
# the release version as well.

svn checkout https://svn.r-project.org/R/trunk/ ~/R-stuff/devel

# or both. (if you want to have devel and release versions of R on your machine) 

svn checkout https://svn.r-project.org/R/branches/R-3-3-branch/ ~/R-stuff/release-3-3
```

* Download recommended packages for R, this is available after you change into your
  `devel or release-3-3`  directory.

```{bash tool-sync, eval=FALSE}
# Download recommmended packages
./tools/rsync-recommended
``` 

* Be sure to configure R in a different directory as to where it was downloaded.
  All the libraries being installed will go into that directory.

```{bash r-install, eval=FALSE}
# make a new directory to configure R

mkdir -p ~/R-stuff/bin/R-devel

cd ~/R-stuff/bin/R-devel

~/R-stuff/devel/configure --enable-R-shlib --enable-R-profiling --enable-memory-profiling --with-internal-tzcode=no
```

* Once the configuration goes through without any errors, run make

```{bash, eval=FALSE}
# run make
make

# Then check the built system works correctly by
make check

```

* Install R-studio from this [link](https://www.rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/).

Once R-studio is installed, and you have manually compiled R, you have to create an
alias for your R-studio in your .bashrc or whatever shell you are using on your machine.

The alias will look like, 

```{bash alias-r-studio, eval=FALSE}
# R release version; i.e latest release branch, use absolute paths
# when making aliases. This makes it accessible by just using R in the 
# terminal.
alias R="/Users/hansolo/R-stuff/bin/R-devel/bin/R"

# This tells Rstudio which R to use as default
export RSTUDIO_WHICH_R=/Users/hansolo/R-stuff/bin/R-devel/bin/R;
```

* If you have multiple versions of R installed on your machine via source compilation,
one way to refer to multiple version of R and Rstudio via aliases is given below.

In your `.bashrc` you can have something like:

```{bash multiple-sources, eval=FALSE}
# R release/patched version; i.e latest release branch
alias R-release="/Users/hansolo/R-stuff/bin/R-3-3-branch/bin/R"
alias RStudio-release="export RSTUDIO_WHICH_R=/Users/hansolo/R-stuff/bin/R-3-3-branch/bin/R; open -a RStudio"

# R devel setup
alias R-dev="/Users/hansolo/R-stuff/bin/R-devel/bin/R"
alias RStudio-dev="export RSTUDIO_WHICH_R=/Users/hansolo/R-Stuff/bin/R-devel/bin/R; open -a RStudio"
```

Now you can call your **R-release** version using the command `R-release` and if you use the command `RStudio-release` , Rstudio will use the release version of R. Same goes with the commands `R-dev` and `RStudio-dev`.


**All done!!**


Try out the installation in a new terminal or after sourcing your `.bashrc` by

```{bash source-bash, eval=FALSE}
source ~/.bashrc
```

You should be all set and ready to use R!
