abstract: |
  We'll take a fast-paced tour through R and the software project I
  work on, Bioconductor (https://bioconductor.org), learning how to
  explore and visualize large cancer-related data sets. We'll work
  through two particular analyses. In the process, we'll learn some
  pretty significant new R skills. For instance, we will learn about
  formal classes for representing complex data, strategies for
  iteration and parallel processing, and accessing 'remote' resources
  accessible through web-based interfaces. This workshop should be
  interesting to people who know a bit of R, and want to learn more!
