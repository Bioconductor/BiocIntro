  Now is an incredibly exciting time for you to participate in
  bioinformatic research, with new methods for generating and
  analyzing large genomic data sets emerging almost daily. As
  bioinformaticians, we need a large, comprehensive, current,
  established, well supported, open source, community developed
  collection of software to address our leading-edge needs. This
  presentation describes the _Bioconductor_ project, providing exactly
  these resources for the _R_ bioinformatics community. We'll learn a
  little about the history, philosophy, and approach of the
  _Bioconductor_ project. We then walk through essential steps in
  getting started with _Bioconductor_, tackling real analytic
  challenges, and contributing to the _Bioconductor_
  community. With luck, the presentation will inspire and empower you
  to tackle new and innovative challenges in your own bioinformatic
  research.
